SElinux security:
                Security-Enhanced Linux is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, 
                including mandatory access controls. SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions
       
    
Commands of SELinux Security are:
    1. getinforce - to enforce the privacy policy
    2. sestatus - to get information about the current status of SELinux 


SELinux modes:
There are three modes of SELinux:
 
Enforcing, Permissive and Disabled.
1)Enforcing mode is the default mode at installation of SELinux. It will enforce the policies on the system, deny access and log actions.
2)Permissive mode is the most commonly used mode for troubleshooting SELinux. In this mode, SELinux enables but does not enforce security policies. Also, this means that actions will result in a warning and log for the system administrator.
3)Disabled mode means that SELinux is turned off and the security policies do not protect the server.
