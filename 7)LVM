LVM: LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager.
     LVM is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. 
     Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the point of being able to have their root file systems on a logical volume.
     LVM is used for the following purposes: Creating single logical volumes of multiple physical volumes or entire hard disks (somewhat similar to RAID 0, but more similar to JBOD),
     allowing for dynamic volume resizing.



Commands used in LVM:
  1.create a pv    - pvcreate [devices]
  2.show a pv      - pvdisplay
  3.create a vg    - vgcreate vgname [pv]
  4.show a vg      - vgdisplay
  5.create a lv    - lvcreate -n name -L [size] name
  6.show a lv      - lvdisplay
