 Hard link:
         Hard links more flexible and remain linked even if the original 
         or linked files are moved throughout the file system, although hard links are unable to cross different file systems.
         ls -lsbcommand shows all the links with the link column shows number of links.
         A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. 
         It accesses the data available in the original file.
         If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.

 Soft link:
          Soft link is an indirect pointer to a file od a directory.
          It does not access the data available in the original file. 
          If the earlier file is deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.
          Soft links are comparativly slower.

 Commands for hard link and soft link:
          To make symbolic links instead of hard links, use: ln -s source link
          To verify soft or hard links on Linux, run: ls -l source link
